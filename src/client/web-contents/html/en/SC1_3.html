                                                        - Talktime fees are charged by every 1 second after a call is successfully connected to the "receiver". When a call does not connect, fees are not charged.<br/>
                                                        - The call duration time displayed on your mobile phone screen increases from the moment you attempt to make a call. However, before the receiver answers the call, talktime is not incurred.
